# FANG Velocity Controller 

The FANG a REX 1727 project designed to provide an __embeded__ solution to the automatic control 
problem. The FANG is meant to be used in combination with an FRC legal PWM motor controller as well as
an FRC legal input sensor. 

## Current State
This repository is currently used purely as a _prototyping_ branch and contains the main arduino code 
to be used on the Arduino MINI PRO.

## Dependencies
This velocity controller uses the Ben Buxton Quadrature Encoder library which can be found [here](https://github.com/buxtronix/arduino/tree/master/libraries/Rotary).
